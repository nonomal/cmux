/// The iOS terminal's keyboard input surface.
///
/// This is a **documentless responder**, not a text editor. It conforms to
/// ``UIKeyInput`` and ``UITextInput`` directly on a bare `UIView` (the same
/// construction iSH's `TerminalView` ships) instead of subclassing
/// `UITextView`. Every committed character is forwarded to the remote Mac and
/// nothing is echoed locally, so there is no editable buffer to keep in sync —
/// the view owns only a transient IME ``markedText`` string.
///
/// ## Why not a `UITextView`
///
/// A `UITextView` (or any real-document field) drives backspace auto-repeat and
/// dictation off its internal text storage and selection, not off
/// ``UIKeyInput/hasText``. The previous implementation forced `hasText` to
/// `true` but cleared its document to `""` after every keystroke, so:
///
/// - **hold-to-repeat backspace** stopped after one delete: with an empty
///   document and a collapsed selection at offset 0 the framework had nothing to
///   repeat-delete, and a `UITextView` never consults the overridden `hasText`
///   for repeat.
/// - **system dictation** never landed: dictation inserts a placeholder into the
///   document then replaces it with the recognized text, but the per-keystroke
///   `text = ""` clear nuked the placeholder mid-flight.
///
/// A bare ``UIKeyInput``/``UITextInput`` responder with no document has neither
/// problem. The framework honors ``hasText`` for repeat on a raw responder, and
/// the explicit dictation-placeholder methods on a real (non-cleared)
/// `UITextInput` conformer let recognized text arrive through ``insertText(_:)``
/// as one multi-character block, which routes to the bracketed-paste sink.
///
/// Autocorrect/predictive text stay **disabled** here and fundamentally cannot
/// be enabled: they require the field to retain the in-progress word, which is
/// incompatible with forwarding every keystroke to a remote terminal.
